# Providers and Referring Providers

Base profile: <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/practitioner.html>

## Practitioner Types Supported by EMA

EMA supports two types of practitioners:

1. Standard Practitioners:\
   This includes any staff member within the practice. Typically, you can distinguish between a provider and other staff members by the presence of an NPI (National Provider Identifier) for providers.
2. Referring Providers:\
   These can be identified by querying the API with the following parameter:\
   `/Practitioner?type=ref`\
   This query will return all referring providers associated with the practice.

The following attributes are supported on ALL Practitioner calls:
