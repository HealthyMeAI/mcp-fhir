# Encounters/Visits

Base profile: <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/encounter.html>

### Understanding Visits and Encounters

Visits, including **Telehealth visits** and **Non-Visit Orders**, are represented in the /Encounter resource. It's important to note that **Encounters** are distinct from **Appointments**. Think of an appointment as a placeholder for a potential encounter.

* **Standard Workflow:**\
  When an encounter is created from an appointment (which is the typical workflow), there will be a reference link between the two. However, in cases where a user deviates from the standard process, this link may not exist.
* **Non-PM System Practices:**\
  If the practice is not using our Practice Management (PM) system, MMPM, then the appointment data will not be linked to the encounter resource.
* **Encounter Status:**\
  While an encounter is still in progress, you will not be able to retrieve the **Visit Note** (document) or the **Charges** (`ChargeItems`). These details only become available once the encounter is marked as "finished."

Common use cases include:

* Find all Encounters (visits) for a patient
